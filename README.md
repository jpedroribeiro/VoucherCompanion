# VoucherCompanion 🙍
Proof of concept of a Chrome extension that detects (1) if the current merchant page has any offers on VoucherCodes.co.uk. 

If **positive** 🙋, display the offer and a link to the site.

If **negative** 🤷‍♀️, display a similar merchant offer and a link to the site.

(1) Currently parsing JSON (this is a hackathon project after all!), future iterations could use an API.
